        If you are like most software engineers, web developers, or app developers
        - sales and marketing are not things you enjoy. In fact, most times I've mentioned
        the topic in conversations with developers, I am usually met with what amounts to 'ugh' .
        In my experience, software developers generally draw a hard line between 'doing' or 'building'
        things -- and 'selling' them. I'm going to show you why branding yourself is the most important thing you can do to land that software development job you've been dreaming of, and what steps you need to take in order to get started right now.
        Why is a personal brand important for software developers looking for a job?
        Whether you realize it or not, every time you answer a job posting, attend a networking event, or even shoot off your portfolio, you are indeed marketing something -- yourself.
        So, if we can't avoid it, let's at least make sure you market yourself effectively. And for that, let me show you the most important concept in marketing:
        Positioning Consider a billboard. Positioning refers not only to its physical location, but also its content -- as it relates to the audience. For a commercial, positioning relates to everything from its channel, time of day, region, show, as well as its content and audience.
        Positioning describes how you craft your message, how you place it, and who you are targeting. The better you adjust all these factors, the better the chance your message will be received. In this case, the chance you will land the job.
        Let's Get Started With Branding
        To begin, let's ignore who you are for a second. Instead, let's consider what sort of company you want to work for as a software developer:
        Do you want to work in a big corporate office?
        A small, fun startup?
        Or, maybe you want to work from a beach with a laptop and a Mai Tai?
        Given your choice, think about what attributes someone hiring a software developer for your ideal company might value in an employee.
        If a big corporation is your goal, then you might imagine they value a professional and business-like candidate.
        A startup might value creativity, independence, and personality.
        A remote position might better suit someone who's well-traveled and can prove they are adept at self-management.
